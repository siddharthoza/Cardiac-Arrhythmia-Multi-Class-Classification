Cardiac Arrhythmia Multy-Class Classification

## Abstract: 
This study is conducted to classify patients into one of the sixteen subclasses, among which one class represents absence of disease and the other fifteen classes represent electrocardiogram records of various subtypes of arrhythmias.

## Goal: 
As it is a huge dataset with nearly 280 variables first I performed feature selection technique to identify the important variable. Then I applied simple machine learning models like KNN, logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, linear & kernalised SVM and compared the precision and recall of each of the above mentioned models. After running the simple models I wanted to see how these models perform after bagging and boosting. As the data file had 280 variables, PCA looked as the best option.Hence after performing PCA on the above models we got the best model with accuracy as 75%.
